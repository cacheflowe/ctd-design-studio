# Creative Freelancing

This advice applies to being a freelance developer, designer, artist, etc.

From [Joel Swanson](http://joelericswanson.com/) & [Justin Gitlin](https://cacheflowe.com).

## Form an LLC

  - Register with the [Secretary of State](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/business/businessHome.html)
  - Open a bank account for the LLC so you can easily track your business expenses
  - Do a local and national business entity search so you don’t choose a name that someone else has. Make it distinct so you don't get in legal trouble later
  - 1099 / W-9 vs W-2
    - As an LLC, you give all of your clients a W-9 form, and they give you a 1099 at the end of the year 
      - Have your clients pay your LLC, not you!
    - W-2 is what you get from a full-time employer

## Taxes

- Find a CPA
  - Especially as you have an LLC, getting someone else to do your taxes is key!
    - They can save you lots of money & time
    - A CPA is an added layer of protection - it's on them if your taxes aren't done right
- Start paying [estimated quarterly taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/self-employed-individuals-tax-center). Most of your clients are going to pay you without taking out taxes, so you are responsible for paying the taxes on any income you receive. 
- Use your small business banking account to track all your expenses
- At the end of the year your clients will send you a 1099 (additional income form) and if you haven’t been paying a percentage of all your income you are going to owe the IRS a big bill, perhaps even with a penalty.
- 40% of youre revenue is a good number to target for your assumed tax liability

## Business Expenses

- Track your expenses (tools, subscriptions, materials, advertising, entertainment). You can deduct a lot as long as you keep track of it. This will help you offset all those 1099’s at tax time by reducing your taxable income. Justin uses Quickbooks Online to do this.
  - Mileage
  - Meals (track local and non local as they get dedicated at different rates)
  - Home office
  - Tech (phones, computers, software can deduct a percentage)
  - Internet, Phone bills (percentages)
  - Materials
  - Memberships
  - Marketing (promotion, websites hosting, business cards, video recaps etc.)

## Financial Projections

- Make a spreadsheet of your fixed monthly expenses, your expected one-off expenses (i.e. new desk & chairs), and some flexible numbers (hours worked per week, hourly rate, monthly personal & business expenses). The point is to get an idea of how much you need to work to bring in a livable income.

  Here's a basic example with a $100/hr. rate and $3,500 monthly expenses, which will drastically vary per-person:

  | Weeks | Avg. Hours / week | Hours / year | Rate | Yearly Revenue | Minus Taxes | Takehome per month | After expenses |
  |-------|-------------------|--------------|------|----------------|-------------|--------------------|----------------|
  | 52    | 16                | 832       | $100 | $83,200        | $54,387     | $4,532             | $1,032         |
  | 52    | 24                | 1,248     | $100 | $124,800       | $84,339     | $7,028             | $3,528         |
  | 52    | 30                | 1,560     | $100 | $156,000       | $106,803    | $8,900             | $5,400         |

## Business insurance

- Get general liability insurance (some clients will require this). 
  - [Hiscox](https://www.hiscox.com/small-business-insurance) is a common, inexpensive option
- Get health insurance on the exchange. THis is *not* a business expense, but factor it into your financial projections

## Bidding Projects

- If you can just work hourly when starting out do it.
- You need to figure out what your time is worth: x
- Then estimate how many hours you think it will take to complete the project, and (or 50% - Justin)
- Then come up with a materials budget, at 10-20% markup
- Factor in revisions
- Add a contingency
- Subcontract when needed

## Market yourself

- This is why we are so keen on documentation. You need to convince people that you can do cool sh*t. 
- Make a website, get a business card, develop your business identity
- [Document your projects](documentation-tips.md)
- Have a good bio/statement/description of who you are and what you do
- You are all in CTD so you know the value of a portfolio.
- Content is more important than the overall design—focus on your work
- Get on social media.
  - Start following people who do the work you want to do.
  - [Instagram For Visual Artists](https://yngspc.com/news_opinion/2017/02/instagram-dos-and-donts-for-artists/)
- Get Paid! Don't be bashful about letting people know what the terms are, and if they're late to pay you. You're a business

## Network

- Locally, do meetups, go to gallery openings, find your tribe & build your community
- Keep in contact with people
- Professional connections from the past are your best route to find new work
  - But you never know where a magical new connection will come from, outside of your professional network
- Find conferences: 
  - EYEO
  - Transmediale
  - MUTEK
  - OFFF
