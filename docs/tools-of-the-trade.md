## How to choose a computer(s)

- Power (CPU & GPU), OS, size, cost
- Power & OS will determine what you can accomplish with your tools
- Size & cost will be determined by project budget & spatial limitations
  - Raspberry Pi <-> Gaming PC
- Will it be outside? You’ll need AC/heat

## Software tools

- Creative coding frameworks & libraries
- Adobe / C4D, etc
- Server for data/media processing
- Cloud services & integrations
  - Email, text messages

## Video: 

- HDMI, Displayport (with version numbers)
- Resolution & refresh rate
- Video splitters/mappers/media servers (FX4, D3, Watchout, triplehead2go)
- 50/100’ HDMI cable (this is directional!)
- Repeaters for long runs
- HDMI over Ethernet 
- Projectors
- LED panels

## Communication protocols: 

- UDP / OSC / WebSockets
- HTTP
- MIDI
- Syphon / Spout / RTP
- DMX / Artnet

## Input devices

- Keyboard/mouse
- Touchscreen
- PI Engineering devices (interesting buttons)
- Gamepad devices for custom input switches
- Webcam or CamLink / capture card - HDMI -> USB webcam (UVC)
- Depth cameras: Kinects / Realsense 
- Thermal or infrared cameras
- Sensors (usually via custom hardware: Arduino / Raspberry PI / Teensy / etc.)
  - Piezo vibration sensor (acoustic drum triggers)
  - Capacitive paint
  - Accelerometer
  - Altitude
  - Linear encoder
  - Rotary encoder

## Audio

- Basic consumer-level speakers
- Pro-audio equipment

## Cabling 

Note/opinion: hard-lines are generally much more robust & dependable than wireless connections

- Ethernet cable/protocol extenders
  - USB ethernet extender
  - HDMI ethernet extender
  - DMX over ethernet
  - POE (Power Over Ethernet)
- 100’ MIDI cable
- HDMI/Displayport cables
- Audio cables (3.5mm or fancier)

## Basic digital hardware to have on-hand

- Wireless keyboard & trackpad: Logitech K400
- Mini monitor
- USB hub & dongles
- Extension cables & power strips/splitters
- Mini test units to check other hardware (ex: small DMX light)

## Physical tools

Note: Go to estate sales for cheap traditional tools (wrenches, hammers, ladders, saws)

- Wire stripper/cutter
- Screwdrivers
- Soldering gun
- Zip ties
- Gaffe tape & electrical tape

## Backups! 

Always bring 2 of something that’s totally essential 

## Comfort on-site

- Camping chair
- Water bottle
- Coffee mug
- Spork
- Snacks

## Remote management

- Teamviewer
- Custom check-in/heartbeat code

## Documenting your work on the cheap

- Tripod
