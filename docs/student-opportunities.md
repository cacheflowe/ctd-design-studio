OK Senior art & design students, now that you are on winter break, and assuming you are planning to graduate in the Spring, we need to have a little chat about the upcoming semester. Get a warm beverage and settle in.

Spring semester is likely going to be stressful in ways you have not dealt with yet, and potentially a lot less enjoyable than you might anticipate, so I want to implore to keep a few things in mind when you get back to campus:

- Everybody is freaking out about getting a job, not just you. Even the few who already have a job are freaking out about doing well, moving to a new city, paying their bills, loan payments, etc. Try to realize everyone is in the same boat as you no matter how they may appear.

- With this in mind: do not be a passive/aggressive asshole about the interview you got, or the studio visit you are about to go on. Offhand comments about how tired you are because your [Pentagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagram_(design_firm)) interview was soooooooo intense are not needed.

- Be proud of your accomplishments, but try to keep your business to yourself. Some of your classmates have not gotten any interviews yet and don’t need to know that [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is is moving you to SF and giving you a Tesla & unlimited avocados. Bragging is not needed.

- Remember that your classmates are the people you worked with, sweated with, learned Adobe with, kerned type with, made apps with, and generally created and learned with for 4+ years — treat each other with kindness. **These people are your first professional network**.

- If you hear about a job you don’t want, or a lead you are not interested in, or an opportunity you can’t take — **PASS IT ON TO YOUR CLASSMATES**. Help each other out. You are all in this together wether you realize it or not. Be supportive and kind.

- Do your very very very best to stop comparing yourself with your classmates — that way only lies pain. One person’s dream job is another person’s nightmare, so you should just spend time figuring out what is good for you & what kind of work environment you want to be in.

- Not every amazing design job is in SF or NYC. Not every amazing design job is at a hip studio. Not every amazing design job is at a 4-letter named agency. Seriously. Open up your search.

- You won't believe it now, but I promise you that the people you are about to graduate with are the people who will have info on jobs, projects, & opportunities in the future. So treat each other with respect or it will likely come back to bite you in the ass.

- There will be moments — many moments — before and after graduation when you feel like you have no idea WTF you are doing and are worried about making bad decisions. This feeling will last until you die. Don't worry about it. Also, welcome to adulthood.

- Seriously: it is going to be fine. You will figure it out one way or another. It will work out. Also, there are people who have your back and have experience and want you to succeed and will help you as best as they can: these people are your faculty.
