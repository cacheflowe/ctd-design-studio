# Documentation Tips

## From [Joel Swanson](http://joelericswanson.com/)

- Pay a professional. If you can afford it, get a professional to document your work. It is the best money you could spend. We all think we can take good pictures because we have a smartphone, but believe the lie! They will have the camera, lighting, and technical expertise to make your work look great! You can often trade services for photography as well (e.g. will you photograph my installation? I will build you a website in return.)
- Get high res images. You never know when you will be asked for a print resolution file (get RAW camera files)
- Get organized. I have a Folder on my Google Drive that all the documentation I have. It is organized by year and event. Getting a system in place now will save you so much time in the future
- Photograph users. Especially with interactive works, get some friends to act as users. Getting images/videos of users in your work give a sense of scale, but also personality.
- Do multiple sessions. If I am documenting a show or installation myself, I  like to do a round of photographs and video and then sit with it for a while. Then if I need to, I can come back before the show/installation comes down.
- Get boring shots. Funky Dutch and cool wide angle shots, but get the boring straight on perspective shots. These are the ones you will use the most.
- Get details. Donâ€™t neglect the trees for the forest. Get close up detail shots.
- Pay attention to lighting. I tend to like morning light, but scout your location to see when the best light is. If you need to, bring your own lighting.

- Write a script. Plan the story you want to tell with your shots & actors. Show a real-life user flow so the viewer can understand the UX journey.
  - Show actors havving a "moment" with the piece. Capture them smiling & having fun.
- Create a shot list. What are the important angles and approaches that help explain the scale, spatiality, and unique elements. Get close-ups and far-away shots that contextualize the setting and intricacies.
- Capture good audio. The sounds in the space can help tell the story. Does the installation make its own sounds? This might be harder to capture and require extra equipment, but take the extra time to make sure you have a good audio signal to weave into the final video edit. 
- Don't make it too long. Less is more.
- Consider adding closed-captioning or text overlays, as many people watch video without sound.
