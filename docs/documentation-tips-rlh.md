(document intended for photographers / videographers shooting Lozano-Hemmer's work)

## Goal

The purpose of documenting is to have a complete register of what the artwork is: a) Installation: what are the elements, how do they hang or mount and interconnect, crate opening, layout and inventory of parts, b) Exhibition: how it works with one person, with a crowd and when there is no one. Ensure first and foremost that you make a list of the different shots that will accomplish that. Make sure to understand the piece: normally media art pieces have two, three or four modes or behaviours. Be sure to learn what these behaviours are and ensure that all of them are represented on both film and photography.

## Establishing shots

We always need establishing shots, which are made of two types of shots. One type, are shots of the piece with a tripod, static, with no one in front of it. We don't want the camera to move so that the movement of the piece itself can be captured and understood. If the piece can be frozen, you can do a long exposure for photography. For stills, do play with exposures so that if the piece is in movement, then you may have some shots showing the animation moving and leaving trails and some with shorter exposures to have it captured still. The second type of establishing shot is the same camera position and settings but with visitors. No zooming ever during footage. If you need a closer shot then get physically closer.

## Visitors

The visitor should be a person who walks in and looks at the work. He or she is not rushed, should be interested in what is happening, not making big expressions, just taking it in. Not looking at the camera. They are participating slowly and gradually. They wear clothes that do not have patterns, and ideally bring a pale and a dark option. The visitor stands very close to the artwork, beside not in front of it, unless they are simply crossing across the video shot.

Throughout this time, the camera does not move. It is useful to have a second camera on the other side to capture their reactions face on (reaction videos). The gradual presentation of the artwork by this one or two visitors should happen with people that are not supermodels. People should be ideally dressed in a way that does not call attention to them at all, they should be normal, museum-goers. Having as a subject an elderly woman or man is always better than a young person.

Once you have footage of the single person, do also capture the work with general public members, eg. families, groups, couples. Often the best shots come from people who are reacting to the work as they first see it, not staged, ideally the camera is slightly hidden, or is small, so that they are not self-conscious.

## Artwork details

Have close-ups of the artwork as well as the gear that is being used and the details of the mechanisms being used. Take photos of the backroom if there is one: how pieces were done.

Make sure you also get a sense of how the immersion happens by including what is in the rest of the room. Once you have done all the documentary angles, you can do more artistic angles, such as having an ultra-wide lens or the camera at ground level pointed up, or elevating the camera with a riser, or placing the camera on a dolly or a timelapse. But these are optional and depend on the work. Ensure that you try a variety of lighting techniques and exposures to get the emphasis on the artwork, not on the public. As a rule of thumb use cameras with good low light performance so that you do not need to add additional light. A shot we love is with the public photographed over their shoulder so we can see what they see, do include a bit of the back of their head and shoulder though.

## Scale

Ensure that you always have a person standing far away from the camera and close to the artwork for a perfect scale. Often we place this person unnaturaly close to and beside the work and more or less still, while another person walks into the shot and gradually approaches it.

## Behaviour

Have a variety of people try, play, and experiment with the artwork. Less staged, more improvised. For this, you need to spend time for general audience members to actually do something interesting. Feel free to stage the behaviours but it should not look staged.

## Sound

Use an external mic or at least a shotgun mic so that the camera noise is not a factor. Mic people with a lav if you can. Always record room tone.

## Vox Pop

Interview some general visitors about the piece: what did they think about it? what does it remind them of? how did the piece make them feel? is this what they expect art to be like? Any surprises? Interview the curator. Interview the gallery attendants and guards. Interview the most eccentric people you can find around. Interview kids and seniors. Interview grumpy people who seem to be completely unimpressed.

## Colour Temperatures

We care about consistency, we often shoot warmer than daylight, like 5000k, but of course this depends on the lighting, screens, etc. If there is a conflict eg screen at 6000k and incandescent at 2500k then choose a mid point closer to the screen. We rather the people be orange than the screens blue. Use a colour chart to calibrate and keep it in the recording for colour retouching.

## Flicker

If you are in Europe or somewhere with 50Hz electricity please use multiple of 50 for your frame rate, eg 1080/50hz whereas in North America with 60Hz electricity use multiples of 60, eg 1080/60Hz.

## Low light

While in most cases you may not want a high sensitivity such as ISO 1200 or higher due to grain, often in media art the work is dark and instead of bringing artificial light in we prefer shooting with higher ISOs, the grain can be somewhat removed in post whereas no detail in dark areas cannot be solved. Bringing artificial light that does not belong in the piece is strongly discouraged, unless it is subtle light on the visitor.

## Resolution

Please shoot in as high a resolution as possible and submit files in lossless compression codecs. We love ProRes and DNGs. Please remove or trim bad shots that are out of focus, jittery, boring, or anything else that we don't need for our edit.

## Rights

Lozano-Hemmer studio and the Gallery will always credit the photographer or videographer as the shots are used in social media, catalogs, press, documentary films or other uses. The shots should be taken on a per-hire basis, with no additional cost to reproduce them non-exclusively and non-commercially.
