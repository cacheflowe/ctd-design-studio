# Crunch Time

- What are the most important elements to tell the story? Be honest in your self-assessment. Detach from elements that you might like, but aren't helpful to the cohesive whole.
- What are the most important features to the client?
- How polished does each element need to be, versus how complete is the total product?
- Are there any tasks that are holding up other tasks? 
  - What are the bottlenecks?
  - How can you communicate and collaborate with your team to remove roadblocks and increase transparency and come up with solutions?
  - Do you have all of the equipment you need to complete all of the tasks?
- If something isn’t going to make it into the project, communicate this ASAP. It’s far better to be disappointing with clear upfront communication than to not deliver what you promised!
- Final user testing to find holes in the UX plan. How effective & understandable can the project be?
  - What aren’t test users understanding, and how can you mitigate this?
  - Are you finding anything that you thought was important, but is not to users? (Show Flail or Fail)
  - What can you tweak to make sure it's working in the ways that people are naturally using it?
- If you’re in good shape and have all essential features built, what final polish can you add to make it extra delightful and increase personality/memorability?
- Keep documenting the project - these final moments can show essential parts of the process
  - Post on all social channels, email blast, send to colleagues
- Can you do all of this and still be fun to be around? 
- Are there any components of the project that can be extracted/modularized/open-sourced to become part of your ongoing toolkit?
  - Could you write a blog post or case study about the project to further your portfolio and online presence as an expert in the subject matter?
