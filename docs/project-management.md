- Schedule & resource planning
- Prototypes (design/motion & technical/physical)

- Frequent communication & status updates
- Delivery
- Maintenance

## Project planning

- Time & personnel management
  - "Resource Management"
  - GANTT chart ([example](http://ralstonroadcafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gantt-Chart-Dependencies.jpg)) - some project management tools have this built-in
  - Spreadsheets (lots of spreadsheets)
  - Other communication tools: Slack, group text, etc
  - Track your business pipeline & external responsibilities
  - Regular check-ins with your team. Standups?
- Tech specs
  - Put together materials list
  - Which technologies will you use?
  - Develop a technical diagram to show how your experience will work from a - technical standpoint (kinect links to computer links to TV) 
- Put together a rough budget, and track actual expenses so you know if you're hitting the limit

## Client management

- Educate the client about your process, but you are working for them - this is a fine balance
- Communicate as much as possible - the client needs to feel comfortable that you're making the right amount of progress and will be able to hit the deadline
  - Continued expectation-setting along the way
  - Continual re-estimation of your time & budget internally & w/client
- Pivots & new features are inevitable, but these might cost more money. Is there more money? Or do you need to cut features?
- What is possible for MVP vs release day? 
  - Be realistic with yourself & again, *communicate as much as possible*

## Roadblocks

- Look for different solutions if you can't wrangle the technology in time. Potentially change the concept to work with what you *can* achieve
- Necessity is the mother of invention
  - Make sure client agrees
