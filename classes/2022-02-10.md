    - Test your theories with users ASAP

## 📝 Homework

### Continue prototyping

### Next class, present an updated pitch deck with your latest thinking on:
  - Concept
  - Timeline
  - Hardware budget
  - What has changed and why? What constraints, ideation, and prototyping have led to these changes?

### Begin ongoing documentation

- Set up a group web site, and any social accounts & integrations
- Start collecting media & artifacts of your work, to be folded into the case study
- If you post to social accounts, use the hashtag [#ctddesignstudio](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/ctddesignstudio/)
