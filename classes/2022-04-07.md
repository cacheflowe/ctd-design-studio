## Justin updates from the field

- Processing prototype
  - Share your progress! 
    - Bite-sized updates are more understandable
    - Let go of your imposter
  - Got lots of positive feedback
  - Why do people like this?
- [THREE.js](threejs.org/) - [r3f](https://codesandbox.io/s/solitary-violet-mvm234?file=/src/App.jsx)
  - Learning new tools!
    - I'm generally conservative with my tool choices
      - You don't want to get stuck with old technology
    - Some people are always looking for the next thing
  - React (FB) ü§Æ
    - Interesting functional/declarative code patterns
  - r3f: A better abstraction 
    - Higher level code that removes the need to known as much
    - Instead of writing 20 lines of code, you write 1
    - Akin to TouchDesigner vs. Processing
  - WebMIDI
