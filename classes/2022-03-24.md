# No Class! | Mar 24

## ðŸ™… Spring Pause - No Class

*From [CU](https://www.cpr.org/2020/10/22/cu-boulder-cancels-spring-break-will-add-more-student-events-and-mental-health-support-next-semester/):*

> The week of March 22-26 will be used in this class as a spring pause to provide us all with a safe and supportive way to promote health, wellness and learning without leaving campus. During this week, we wonâ€™t have any exams or assignments due. We will still have class with interactive class activities that will require your attendance and be part of your final course grade. While March 25 is a wellness day, attendance is still required for all other class sessions that week. I wish we could take a regular spring break, but public health concerns prevent us from doing so. I would like to emphasize that it is still important for you all to behave responsibly. Do not use the week to travel or engage in risky behavior that could result in an outbreak on campus after we all return.
