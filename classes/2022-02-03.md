## üí∏ Budgets

- Announce budget allocation
  - How to order equipment
    - Kepp a spreadsheet of what you need and what you've spent
    - Canvas has Sara's info - she can order equipment
    - You *can* order items yourself, but it's preferable to have Sara do it
    - Before making an order talk to Justin. Let's be respectful of Sara's time and our budgets, and make sure we definitely want the gear we're about to order
- Projector pooling
  - Teams can combine budgets for projectors
  - The ATLAS Equipment Room ("ER") is back open.  Any students or faculty needing to check things out can utilize that resource. Here‚Äôs the info and hours for the semester: https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/equipment
    - Monday 11:15am - 1:15pm
    - Tuesday 11:30am - 4:00pm
    - Wednesday 11:15am - 1:15pm
    - Thursday 11:30am - 4:00pm
    - Friday 11:15am - 1:15pm
  - From Arielle: In addition to the equipment in the ER, there is likely a stash that Bret and the B2 have accessible. Bret might be a good person to spec and procure these projectors since we‚Äôd want ones that will last longer term.  I do know that the darn supply chain may come into play as one of our new Epsons took several weeks to arrive.
