# Design Studio | Thursday Jan 28

## Present your pitch decks

- Turn in pitch decks via form
- Groups present pitches & take feedback & questions
  - Evaluate other groups via form
- Thoughts for evaluation:
  - Does the concept tell a story or solve a problem?
  - Is it focused & understandable?
  - Is it accessible (physically & conceptually)
  - Who is the audience & what is the setting?
  - Will it facilitate the goal of getting visitors to have an interaction together?

## üìù Homework

- **Start prototyping** to prove your ability to build your concept
- Integrate feedback from presentations
- Revisit what's possible given the budget & refine your plan
