## Pitch Progress

- Pitch process
  - There's a problem to solve, and a story to tell
  - Iterate on ideas, do some research & rapid prototyping
  - Figure out the team's strengths & areas to learn
  - Aim high - people are coming to you for your innovative, mindblowing ideas
  - Make an attractive & informative deck (books are judged by their cover)
  - Present the deck to your client in-person - you need to breathe life into that PDF and show how excited & qualified you are to build the project. Answer any questions that come up.
