## Present your pitch decks

- Turn in pitch decks via Canvas
- Groups present pitches & take feedback & questions
  - Evaluate other groups via Jamboard
- Thoughts for evaluation:
  - Does the concept tell a story or solve a problem?
  - Is it focused & understandable?
  - Is it accessible (physically & conceptually)
  - Who is the audience & what is the setting?
  - Will it facilitate the goal of getting visitors to have an interaction together?
