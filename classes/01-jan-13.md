## Course Introduction

- This is the CTD Design Studio
  - We'll be building a single, semester-long project in groups
  - Your lecturer: [Justin Gitlin / Cacheflowe](https://cacheflowe.com)
  - The class is modeled after a real-world client/agency relationship
- Work expectations (Group efforts)
  - Concept pitches
  - Execution / Production
  - User testing
  - Video [documentation](../docs/documentation-tips.md) & [case study](../docs/case-study-examples.md) website 
    - These determine your final grade
- Class policies
  - Be respectful to each other. Be prompt & professional
  - No subcontracting
    - It's not okay to have someone else do your work
    - Borrowing open source code is okay if the license allows. Always credit the original author
    - Make sure your code-borrowing doesn't veer into plaigarism
  - Grading will be based on your concept, execution, problem-solving, professionalism, and importantly, your final documentation & case study web site
  - Office hours are by appointment - the hour before/after class is ideal.I have a full-time job & live in Denver so I'm not around as much as some full-time instructors
- Take Roll
  - Icebreaker: introduce yourself, and your first significant memory of technology
- Syllabus - this GH repo's [README](../README.md)
- [Inspiration](../docs/inspiring-projects.md) presentation
  - Context: Art <-> Client work
  - Review [Creative Coding Notes](https://github.com/cacheflowe/creative-coding-notes)
- Skill surveys
- Warm Up Design Challenge: Creative speed concepting - 5 minutes per match. Make a sketch of your concept
  - While you do this, I will be dividing you into groups based off of your Surveys. Is anyone thinking of dropping?
- Create groups
  - Teams of three/four
  - Introduce Groups - meet your teammates
  - Start discussing what you might want to do. Also be sure to swap information with your team.
  - Create your team name (this can change)
  - Expect to help other groups if you have expertise 
- Pitch process
  - There's a problem to solve, or a story to tell
  - Iterate on ideas, do some research & rapid prototyping
  - Figure out the team's strengths & areas to learn
  - Aim high - people are coming to you for your innovative, mindblowing ideas
  - Make an attractive & informative deck (books are judged by their cover)
  - Present the deck to your client in-person - you need to breathe life into that PDF and show how excited & qualified you are to build the project. Answer any questions that come up.

## Homework

- Prepare to present your pitch to the class at the next class: Jan 27th
- Create your group name/identity/branding
- Ideate concepts around the following overarching problem:
  - **Use your installation to enable 2+ people to have an IRL interaction with each other in a unique way**
    - This can be in the context of an art piece, a brand marketing campaign (real or imagined), or other contexts to help frame the purpose of your work
  - Everybody should bring their skills to the table to create a holistic project that can be built
- Build a pitch deck & presentation about your concept
  - Do as much upfront work as you can to vet the idea. You need to convince me (your client) that this is a great concept, and that you'll be able to execute it (while learning a lot along the way, of course - uncertainties are an exciting part of this business)
  - In your deck:
    - Present the problem you're trying to solve. Set up the story in a compelling way
    - Present your team & respective skills
    - Present your solution to the identified problem
    - Describe the basic design with moodboards, sketches, models, concept art
    - List the hardware/technology/space needed to execute
    - Create a production timeline that explains the phases of the project, relative to the client's own deadlines
    - Create a hardware budget
      - See [example](../docs/example-hardware-budget.md)
