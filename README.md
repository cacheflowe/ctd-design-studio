## Course Description

This course will model itself after a real-world client-agency relationship, where student groups will pitch their concepts and produce a single interactive installation (or online experience) throughout the semester. Small teams will be formed in a way that each team has a wide spread of skills, which will help them execute a highly multidisciplinary project. Beyond design and technology, students will partake in business and marketing exercises to execute, promote and explain their work product. Guest speakers will visit the class throughout the semester, bringing with them a unique set of experiences that speak to the many aspects building a physical interactive installation.

## Objectives

* Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team
  * Empathize with others' skillsets and personalities
* Managing project timelines and multiple work streams
* Explore new technologies, techniques, and concepts
* Learn about the landscape of artists, tools, and roles of people in the "interactive art" field
* Build, document, and present a robust original artwork

### Mar 25

#### 🙅 Spring Pause - No Class

The week of March 22-26 will be used in this class as a spring pause to provide us all with a safe and supportive way to promote health, wellness and learning without leaving campus. During this week, we won’t have any exams or assignments due. We will still have class with interactive class activities that will require your attendance and be part of your final course grade. While March 25 is a wellness day, attendance is still required for all other class sessions that week. I wish we could take a regular spring break, but public health concerns prevent us from doing so. I would like to emphasize that it is still important for you all to behave responsibly. Do not use the week to travel or engage in risky behavior that could result in an outbreak on campus after we all return.
