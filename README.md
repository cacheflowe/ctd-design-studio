## Course Description

This course will model itself after a real-world client-agency relationship, where student groups will pitch their concepts and produce a single interactive installation (or online experience) throughout the semester. Small teams will be formed in a way that each team has a wide spread of skills, which will help them execute a highly multidisciplinary project. Beyond design and technology, students will partake in business and marketing exercises to execute, promote and explain their work product. Guest speakers will visit the class throughout the semester, bringing with them a unique set of experiences that speak to the many aspects building a physical interactive installation.

## Objectives

- Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team
  - Empathize with others' skillsets and personalities
- Managing project timelines and multiple work streams
- Explore new technologies, techniques, and concepts
- Learn about the landscape of artists, tools, and roles of people in the "interactive art" field
- Build, document, and present a robust original artwork
